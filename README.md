# drmariomd
Dr. Mario ported from NES to Sega Mega Drive

project was done in SGDK v1.60
lots of help from this disassembly: https://github.com/brianhuffman/drmario/blob/master/drmario.a65

thanks for Stef for making SGDK, Sik for always answering questions quickly on discord, and ohsat and danibus for making great examples.
I was also inspired by Mairtrus who did the SMB port to MD and Alekmaul who did the Puzzli port to MD.

note that this port is far from complete. here are some of the things it's missing:
* 2P VS
* ending screens
* title screen music (couldn't find a suitable MIDI to convert)
* many sound effects
